Deployment Preparation and Staging Environment Setup

Introduction

This project focuses on preparing for deployment by setting up a staging environment. We configure hosting, manage environment variables securely, and conduct staging tests to ensure a smooth transition to production.

Hosting Platform

We use Vercel for its ease of deployment and seamless GitHub integration.

Steps for Deployment

1. Connecting GitHub Repository to Vercel

Sign in to Vercel and create a new project.

Select the GitHub repository containing the marketplace project.

Configure build settings and enable automatic deployments.

2. Configuring Environment Variables

Create .env.local with necessary keys.

Add variables like NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID, API_KEY in Vercel’s dashboard under Project Settings > Environment Variables.

3. Deploying to Staging

Push the latest code to GitHub.

Deploy the application using Vercel’s automatic build process.

Ensure the deployment completes without errors.

4. Staging Environment Testing

a) Functional Testing

Verify key features such as product listing, search, and cart operations.

Use Cypress for UI testing and Postman for API validation.

b) Performance Testing

Use GTmetrix to analyze speed and responsiveness.

Optimize images and reduce render-blocking resources.

c) Security Testing

Ensure HTTPS is enabled and input fields are validated.

Check for secure handling of API keys and authentication data.

5. Organizing Project Files and Documentation

Maintain a clear folder structure:

DOCUMENTS/  - Planning and testing docs
furniro/    - Source code
  ├── src/
  │   ├── sanity/       - Sanity schema and client files
  │   ├── app/          - Layout, main pages, and routes
  │   ├── components/   - Reusable components
README.md   - Project summary and setup instructions

Document all test cases in a CSV file with details on expected vs. actual results.
Submit performance reports from Lighthouse or GTmetrix.

6. Finalizing Deployment Strategy

Ensure all issues are resolved for production readiness.

Maintain a professional GitHub repository with structured documentation.

Testing, Error Handling, and Backend Integration Refinement

Goal

This phase ensures that the marketplace is fully tested, optimized, and ready for deployment by improving security, performance, and user experience.

Key Areas Covered

Functional Testing – Ensuring product listings, cart operations, and key marketplace features work correctly.

Error Handling – Implementing strategies to manage failures and ensure a smooth user experience.

Performance Optimization – Reducing load times and improving efficiency.

Cross-Browser Compatibility – Ensuring consistent behavior across different devices and browsers.

Security Measures – Implementing best practices to prevent vulnerabilities.

Documentation and Reporting – Keeping a structured record of tests and their outcomes.

Functional Testing

Purpose:

Ensures that essential marketplace operations, including product listings, search functionality, cart operations, and checkout processes, work correctly.

Tools Used:

React Testing Library – Unit testing UI components.

Cypress – Automated end-to-end testing.

Implementation Process:

Define test cases covering core functionalities.

Run automated and manual tests, tracking expected vs. actual results.

Document issues and refine features accordingly.

Error Handling

Why is it Important?

Errors may arise from:

Network Failures – Unstable connections affecting API calls.

Invalid Data Input – Incorrect or incomplete user entries.

Server Issues – Unexpected backend failures.

Strategies Used:

Implement try-catch blocks to handle API failures.

Provide user-friendly error messages instead of vague system errors.

Use fallback UI elements for missing or delayed data.

Example Code:

try {
  const fetchedProducts = await fetchProducts();
  setProducts(fetchedProducts);
  setError(null);
} catch (err) {
  setError(err instanceof Error ? err.message : "Failed to load products");
} finally {
  setIsLoading(false);
}

Loading UI Placeholder:

isLoading ? Array.from({ length: 4 }).map((_, index) => (
  <div key={index} className="relative flex flex-col w-[250px] h-[300px] bg-gray-100 rounded-sm shadow-md animate-pulse">
    <div className="relative w-full h-0 pb-[75%] bg-gray-300"></div>
    <div className="flex flex-col gap-2 p-4">
      <div className="h-6 bg-gray-300 rounded w-3/4 mb-2"></div>
      <div className="h-4 bg-gray-300 rounded w-1/2"></div>
      <div className="h-4 bg-gray-300 rounded w-1/3"></div>
    </div>
  </div>
))

Performance Optimization

Objectives:

Ensure fast loading times and smooth user interactions.

Techniques Used:

Analyze Performance:

Use Lighthouse and GTmetrix to identify bottlenecks.

Reduce Load Time:

Minify JavaScript & CSS.

Enable browser caching.

Cross-Browser & Device Testing

Purpose:

Different browsers render code differently, affecting UI and functionality.

Approach:

Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

Use BrowserStack for device simulation.

Validate responsiveness using CSS media queries.

Security Testing

Key Security Measures:

Prevent Injection Attacks – Validate user inputs.

Secure API Communication – Enforce HTTPS for encrypted data transmission.

Protect Sensitive Data – Store API keys in environment variables.

Tools Used:

OWASP ZAP – Automated security scanning.

Burp Suite – Penetration testing.

User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

Purpose:

Ensures real-world usability by simulating user interactions.

Implementation Process:

Create a UAT checklist covering all major functionalities.

Conduct tests with real users or testers.

Collect feedback and refine the user experience accordingly.

Conclusion

The application is now production-ready with all optimizations and security measures in place. The final step is ensuring the repository is structured correctly and submitting required documents.
