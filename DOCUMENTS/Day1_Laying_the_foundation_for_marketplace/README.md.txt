# Day 1: Lay the Foundation For Your Marketplace Journey

## Overview
On the first day of the Design Jam hackathon, I focused on laying the foundation for the project by writing down handwritten notes. These notes include key ideas, initial sketches, and the projectâ€™s main objectives.

## Contents
- **Handwritten Notes:** Captured images of brainstorming ideas and planning.
- **Project Goals:** A structured approach to how the project will proceed in the next six days.
- **Next Steps:** Preparing for the initial implementation in Next.js.

## Next Milestone
Moving forward, the next step is to start planning the Technical Foundation of Marketplace.
